# Vivacity Tech Software Engineer Application - Frontend Code by Brandon Lisonbee

Welcome to the frontend react application that displays fun information about Brandon Lisonbee!
Upon pulling and starting the code, you will be able to click on an image of myself that will toggle some information about me (assuming you have pulled the backend code as well).

This is simply a demonstration of my abilities as a Software Engineer and is not meant to be much more than a simple tech demo.
